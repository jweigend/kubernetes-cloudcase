# Kubernetes Cloudcase
#### Automated K8s Setup with kubeadm for CentOS 7


At QAware we built a device called "Cloudkoffer". A briefcase with five Intel Nuc PCs 
including a small GB Switch and a Mini Router. 
We use this device for the demonstration of all kinds of Cloud Native Software. 
Real Hardware make it easy to test scalability of Software using Elastic Search or 
Apache Spark.

This project contains scripts to setup a Bare Metal-, KVM- or LXC-Cluster
